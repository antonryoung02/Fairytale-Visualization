457 Intro to Visualization assignment.
Given text data of children's fairytales, our task was to come up with an effective visualization of the data. Typically, reading only allows the audience to understand stories linearly over a long period of time, but my visualization breaks this convention. Viewers can instantly locate strong-emotion points in the story and view how the emotions change as it progresses.

I used a script that parsed text into sentences and performed sentiment analysis using an open source model on Huggingface.
