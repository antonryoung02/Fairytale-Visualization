        <h3>What do you want to achieve?</h3>
        <p>I want my visualization help viewers get a broader sense of what happens in each story through the visualization of emotions. 
        </p>


        <h3>How can you highlight a different perspective?</h3>
        <p>Typically, reading only allows the audience to understand stories linearly over a long period of time, but my visualization breaks this convention. Viewers can instantly locate strong-emotion points in the story and view how the emotions change as it progresses.</p>

        <h3>What tasks do you want to support?</h3>
        <p>I want to support a visualization of each emotion together (for comparison between emotions) and separate (for comparison of emotion over time). </p>
        <p>The stories should be split up, and display predicted sentiment probabilities by sentence</p>
        
        <h3>What designs will help you achieve these tasks?</h3>
        <p>I will use stacked column charts for the emotions together and column charts for the emotions individually. I will add an interactive tooltip so the viewer can see what part of the text each bar relates to, and the exact values of each predicted emotion</p>

        <p>I believe this is the clearest way to display this kind of data. The separated charts are necessary to accurately compare the emotion over time, otherwise it can be hard to tell.</p>

        <p>index.html: contains the webpage with the visualizations</p>
        <p>script.ipynb: contains the python data preproccessing</p>
        <p>js folder: contains main.js and SentimentDisplayChart.js, that creates the visualization</p>
